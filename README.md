This is meant to be an application for taking quick notes, which can be
easily expanded into full documents.

Inspired by [todo.sh](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli).

## Getting Started ##

-   Install: `ln -s quicknote /somewhere/in/your/PATH`
-   Configure: `cp quicknote.cfg ~/.quicknote.cfg`
-   Configure: `# And edit if you don't like the defaults`
-   Setup: `quicknote bootstrap`

## Requirements ##

-   `git`
-   `bash`

### TODO ###

-   Open grep hits
-   bash completion
-   Rename config variables so they can be set in .bashrc
